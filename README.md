## Overview

Each member of our team is passionate about the environment and saw the final project as a great way to incorporate our interests with our newly formed data analytics skills.  We decided to use a machine learning model in order to determine the effects certain weather conditions have on air quality.



## Communication Protocols
Our main form of communication is Slack.  We created a group within the application with each group member where we discuss our ideas and strategies for the project.

We also set up rules for committing to the main branch.  We need two people to review and approve before a commit from one of our individual branches can be merged with the main.
