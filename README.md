## Overview

Each member of our team is passionate about the environment and saw the final project as a great way to incorporate our interests with our newly formed data analytics skills.  We decided to use a machine learning model in order to determine the effects certain weather conditions have on air quality within Middle Tennessee.

## Data 
We have two datasets we will combine in order to create a database.  The first is from the EPA's Air Quality System.  This data was gathered through the service's API and contains the level of certain pollutants in the air.  We also have a set of weather data containing information such as location, temperature, precipitation, Wind Speed, etc. for Middle Tennessee.  We hope to gain an understanding of how certain weather conditions affect the air quality within the region.


## Communication Protocols
Our main form of communication is Slack.  We created a group within the application with each group member where we discuss our ideas and strategies for the project.
We also set up rules for committing to the main branch.  We need two people to review and approve before a commit from one of our individual branches can be merged with the main.
